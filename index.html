    <p>The Indian courts have a pendency of 48 million cases, according to a statement made by Kiren Rijiju, Minister of Law and Justice.</p>
    <p>The lion's share of the nation-wide court case pendency comes from the lower courts in the country.</p>
    <p>Some of the cases have been pending in the courts for over 20 years and show up on the court's pendency data even though they have had no progress in years.</p>
    <p>One of the oldest case in BEED is against two men Mustafakha V Umarkha and Mehar V Salemahamd Pathan who were booked for murder in 1966.</p>
